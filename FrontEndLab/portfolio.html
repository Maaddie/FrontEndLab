    1 1/2 lbs Ripe tomatoes, (3-4 medium) sliced 1/4” thick

</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
   Start by layering slices of tomatoes on a serving platter. 
   Tuck slices of cheese between each tomato so both are visible then tuck whole basil leaves between the cheese and tomatoes. 
   Arrange the slices so you can see every layer.
   Season generously with salt and pepper, drizzle all over with extra virgin olive oil and drizzle with 2 Tbsp balsamic glaze or add it to taste.

<h3>Fruit Pastry Puffs</h3>
<img src="FruitPastryPuffs.png" width=350px height="auto">
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>
    8 oz cream cheese, softened
    ¼ cup powdered sugar
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    flour, to coat workstation
    2 sheets puff pastry, thawed
    strawberry, stems removed and sliced
    raspberry
    blackberry
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined.
Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten.
Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares.
On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge.
NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact.
Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape.
Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top.
Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed.
