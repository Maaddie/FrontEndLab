     I was born and raised in South Eastern Europe. Specifically in Bucharest, Romania.
     I discovered my love for cooking about 6 years ago. After I moved in the USA and, since then I never looked back.
     I am always interested in trying new things, learning new tricks and creating new recipes!
     You don't know what to make for dinner tonight? No worries! You are in the right place.

      Before we dive into the fun stuff, I would like to take a bit of your time and tell you about my hometown, Bucharest and the Romanian cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>Back in the day,  Bucharest used to be called the "little Paris of the East" because of the architecture of the elegant architecture that looks so much like Paris and also because it has a replica of the famous Arc de Triomphe, pastry shops and restaurants also made you think that you were in Paris. </p>
    <p>If you ever plan on visiting Bucharest, make sure to DM me in advance, I have a list of places I would recommend. Maybe I will introduce a whole page dedicated to it. That is something I will think about.</p>

    <p>Romanian cuisine has such a blend of different foods that have been borrowed from several traditions. It has Turkish influences as well as Hungarian, Serbian, mostly Eastern and Central european.</p>
