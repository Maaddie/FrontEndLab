<p>Hi! </p>
<p>
Again, thank you for being here! 
As I was telling you in my homepage, my roots are romanian so most of my cooking has Romanian cusine influences.
Growing up, I never sat next to my mom as she cooked. She always would tell me "You have to learn how to make food for yourself Madalina. You will grow up, get married and you will starv."
My mom makes the absolute BEST french fries in the whole world so I think after I moved to the USA I missed her cooking so much and was basically forced to start cooking for myself.
Also, to mention that here in the USA the amount of cuisines you can try and are available to you anytime it's not something I experienced growing up. 
</p>
<p>Mixing up my experiences from my hometown and also from here, I decided to start trying different recipes myself and that is how the adventure starts. With lots of lows and highs. Burnt food... you know... the usual.Haha </p>

<p>If you have any questions about my recipes please email me at foodie@gmail.com</p>
<p>You could also send me an IM on my Instagram profile Foodie.M</p>
